# BAE-12-Project-1
BAE-12 fundamental project

The Task:

The overall objective of the project was to create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate the modules covered during our 5 weeks of training.

My chosen topic:

For this project I chose to create a film watch list where the user could add, display, update and delete films from their list. 

I chose this topic as I’m a big film fan and thought it would be a fun way of using the skills/tools that I have learnt over the past few weeks of training.

Planning:

Before setting up the Jira board, I wrote out a rough plan of what needed to be done in the backend using Java.

I also made a note of what the characteristics of the object “film” would be:

ID,
Title,
Director,
Runtime,
Age Rating

To help plan the project I used a Jira board. This allowed me to set out all the features that I needed for it as a minimum viable product, and then I could extend on those features allowing me to add more detail to the plan.

For this board I set out 2 epics to contain the user stories and tasks: frontend and backend. This allowed me to set the order for what tasks needed to be done at each point.

The stories I created were to set out the main features the application had to have. So all CRUD functionality was included in this.

The tasks were created to be more specific to the technologies used such as Java, SQL, JavaScript etc.

Both epics containing stories and tasks were entered into this 3 day sprint and were both completed in the time frame.

Technologies:

The technologies used in this project: 
* Jira for the Kanban Board
* The database was on an SQL Server
* The programming language used was Java
* The frontend was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Unit tests were completed using J-Unit and Mockito
* Integration tests were completed using MockMVC
* Version control was done using Git/Github 


What went well?

The basic structure of the java code was put together without too many issues. HTML, and JavaScript also came together quite well. I was able to get full functionality from the project so it hit all MVP requirements.

What didn’t?

I had some issues during the testing where some annotations were incorrect, alongside some variable names that were spelt incorrectly causing the tests to fail. These were resolved but it did slow down progress. I also didn’t get time in the end to do as much as I wanted to with CSS and Bootstrap, so the application doesn’t look exactly as I originally planned.

What would i do differently?


With more time I would have added a way of clearing objects from the getBy functions. This way when that object is deleted using the button from there, they should also be cleared. Also I would have spent more time on the styling of the page to make it more presentable to the end user.

Best things I learned


I learned to manage my time well on the project during development, while also managing to handle version control through git. I was also able to practise using a jira board to help with project management and found it a very useful way to keep track of my remaining tasks.
